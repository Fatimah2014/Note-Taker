# Link to Demo

# Description

I created an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses Express.js back end and saves and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
# How To
- GIVEN a note-taking application
- WHEN I open the Note Taker
- THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
- WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
- THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the -  left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
- WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
- THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
- WHEN I click on the Save icon
- THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the   
 left-hand column with the other existing notes
- WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
- THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
- WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
- THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
